# epigenetic-gene-variant-dynamics-analysis
This repository contains the analysis pipeline and scripts for the study "Mapping Epigenetic Gene Variant Dynamics: Comparative Analysis of Frequency, Functional Impact, and Trait Associations in African and European Populations." It includes custom code for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualisation. 
Note: This repository does not include the code used for pre-processing the dataset. The pre-processing tasks were performed using various scripts written in Python, R, and Bash, which require access to original files from the UK Biobank project that are not publicly available.

The datasets associated with the analysis can be found here: (https://zenodo.org/records/12789774). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12789774
